# mcp-mapping-search

This adds a way to look through MCP mappings in a simple(ish) way. To do the same but with Yarn mappings, use the Python file in the `tinytomcp`
folder with an input `.tiny` file and an (optional but suggested) output folder. To use it in the mapping, place the output folder in `csv/` in the
root directory then run the `srg.py` with the name of the folder (not `csv/`, just the name of the folder).
